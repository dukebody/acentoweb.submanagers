acentoweb.submanagers Installation
----------------------------------------

* Add ``acentoweb.submanagers`` to the list of eggs to install
  and to the list of development eggs, e.g.:

    [buildout]
    ...
    eggs =
        ...
        acentoweb.submanagers

    develop =
        ...
        src/acentoweb.submanagers
       
* Tell the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to install a ZCML slug:

    [instance]
    recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
    ...
    zcml =
        acentoweb.submanagers
      
* Re-run buildout, e.g. with:

    $ ./bin/buildout
        
You can skip the ZCML slug if you are going to explicitly include the package
from another package's configure.zcml file.
